# Theory: Comparison of Molar Volume in Van der Waals and Ideal Gas Equations of State

## Introduction

Gases do not always behave ideally, especially at high pressures and low temperatures. The **Ideal Gas Law** assumes no interactions between gas molecules and that the volume of the molecules is negligible. However, real gases deviate from this behavior, and such deviations can be better described by the **Van der Waals Equation of State**. This experiment aims to compare the **molar volume** predicted by both equations under varying conditions of pressure and temperature.

## Ideal Gas Equation

The Ideal Gas Law is given by:

\[
PV = nRT
\]

For 1 mole of gas (i.e., n = 1):

\[
V_m = \frac{RT}{P}
\]

Where:  
- V_m: Molar volume (L/mol)  
- R: Universal gas constant (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)  
- T: Temperature (K)  
- P: Pressure (atm)

This equation assumes:  
- Gas particles have no volume.  
- There are no intermolecular forces.

## Van der Waals Equation

The Van der Waals Equation introduces two correction factors:

\[
\left(P + \frac{a}{V_m^2}\right)(V_m - b) = RT
\]

Where:  
- a: Attraction parameter (accounts for intermolecular forces)  
- b: Repulsion parameter (accounts for finite molecular volume)  
- V_m: Molar volume of the gas  

Solving this equation gives a more accurate value of molar volume V_m under real conditions.

## Significance of Parameters

- **a**: Corrects the pressure due to attractive forces between molecules. Higher values of a indicate stronger attractions.
- **b**: Corrects the volume due to the finite size of molecules. It represents the volume excluded by a mole of particles.

## Objective

To compare the molar volume predicted by the Ideal Gas Law and the Van der Waals Equation for a real gas under various conditions of pressure and temperature.

## Expected Results

- At **low pressure** and **high temperature**, both equations should yield similar results as the gas behaves ideally.
- At **high pressure** and/or **low temperature**, deviations become significant, and the Van der Waals equation provides a more realistic prediction.

## Applications

Understanding deviations from ideal behavior is essential in:  
- Designing chemical reactors  
- Compressing and liquefying gases  
- Developing accurate gas flow simulations
